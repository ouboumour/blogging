# Bash Scripting

## Definition
Bash stands for **B**ourne **A**gain **SH**ell.

Bash is a command interpreter that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions.

Bash is a specific type of **shell**.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Bash Script

Open your favorite text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `gedit`, ...) and create a new file with a `.sh` extension.
For example, `myscript.sh`.

### 2. Shebang Line
Start your script with a shebang line, which tells the system to interpret the script using Bash.
```
#!/bin/bash
```
