# tmux

## Definition

**Tmux** is a **terminal multiplexer**.
**Tmux is** an alternative to **GNU Screen**.

**Tmux** allows you to create many `sessions`.
Each session can be associated with many `windows`.
Each window can be split into rectangular `panes`.
Each pane represents what we refer commonly to with a terminal.

One of the most powerful features that **tmux** offers is
that it keeps your sessions active in the background even if your ssh connection
(for example) drops.
