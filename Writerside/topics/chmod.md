# Chmod

## Definition
The `chmod` command in Linux is used to change the permissions of a file or directory.

Permissions control the access level of users to files and directories.

There are three types of permissions:
- Read (`r`)
- Write (`w`)
- Execute (`x`).

These permissions can be assigned to three entities:
- owner
- group
- others
