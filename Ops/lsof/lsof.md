## Definition
The `lsof` command stands for `list open files`.

It is a powerful tool for displaying information about files that are currently open on a Unix-like system. 

In Unix and Linux systems, everything is considered a file, including regular files, directories, sockets, pipes, and devices. The lsof command helps you to see which processes have opened which files, sockets, or network connections.
